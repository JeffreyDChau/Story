Once upon a time
there was a man who wore silly hats.
he wore tall hats and short hats,
red hats and blue hats.
He had hats that had feathers,
and hats that predicted far off weathers.
There was a magic hat on the other side of the mountain.
He learned and prepared to embark.
He traveled to the other side of the mountain.
On the way he lost his red hat and blue hat.
While climbing the mountain, he fell 200ft down.
There was river in which he thought he would drown.
He paddled and paddled to no avail.
Until a magical beast gave out a wail.
The beast saved the man with his hats.
He befriended the beast using his head pats.

The sea dragon purred, but said not a word.
Accepting his affection as it set off in an upwards direction.
Higher, and higher, and higher they flew.
The hat man wondered if he accidentality sniffed glue.

Far down below the mountain ranged roamed, 
and thats where he spotted where the magical hat called home.
