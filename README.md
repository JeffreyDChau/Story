Once upon a time
there was a man who wore silly hats.
he wore tall hats and short hats,
red hats and blue hats.
He had hats that had feathers,
and hats that predicted far off weathers.
There was a magic hat on the other side of the mountain.
He learned and prepared to embark.
He traveled to the other side of the mountain.
On the way he lost his red hat and blue hat.
While climbing the mountain, he fell 200ft down.
There was river in which he thought he would drown.
He paddled and paddled to no avail.
Until a magical beast gave out a wail.
The beast saved the man with his hats.
He befriended the beast using his head pats.

The sea dragon purred, but said not a word.
Accepting his affection as it set off in an upwards direction.
Higher, and higher, and higher they flew.
The hat man wondered if he accidentality sniffed glue.

Far down below the mountain ranged roamed, 
and thats where he spotted where the magical hat called home.
He spotted a red mountain dragon.
The red mountain dragon lunged at him and ate him.
Next thing he knows, he is back to where he started at the foot of the mountain.

The man wondered what happened. His hat was still there but his body remembers the pain. 
Being desolved slowly and his bones burning from the inside.
He shrugs it off and continues to climb the mountain.
Arriving at the foot of where he once fell. 
Being prepared he made it half way to the top of the mountain.

If only I had a weapon as mad as this situation, he thought.
"Oh wait!" The man shouted, and he stooped on the ground.
He took of his hats, and he punged his arms into the caps. 
The hat was filled with an infinite void, but infinite voids means infinite storage. 
Swirling his fingers around, his hand grazed something metal and cool.
Out of the hat he pulled a word laiden in jewels.
