# Story
Once upon a time
there was a man who wore silly hats.
he wore tall hats and short hats,
red hats and blue hats.
He had hats that had feathers,
and hats that predicted far off weathers.
There was a magic hat on the other side of the mountain.
He learned and prepared to embark.
He traveled to the other side of the mountain.
On the way he lost his red hat and blue hat.
While climbing the mountain, he fell 200ft down.
There was river in which he thought he would drown.
He paddled and paddled to no avail.
Until a magical beast gave out a wail.
The beast saved the man with his hats.
He befriended the beast using his head pats.

The sea dragon purred, but said not a word.
Accepting his affection as it set off in an upwards direction.
Higher, and higher, and higher they flew.
The hat man wondered if he accidentality sniffed glue.

Far down below the mountain ranged roamed, 
and thats where he spotted where the magical hat called home.
He spotted a red mountain dragon.
The red mountain dragon lunged at him and ate him.
Next thing he knows, he is back to where he started at the foot of the mountain.

The man wondered what happened. His hat was still there but his body remembers the pain. 
Being desolved slowly and his bones burning from the inside.
He shrugs it off and continues to climb the mountain.
Arriving at the foot of where he once fell. 
Being prepared he made it half way to the top of the mountain.

If only I had a weapon as mad as this situation, he thought.
"Oh wait!" The man shouted, and he stooped on the ground.
He took of his hats, and he punged his arms into the caps. 
The hat was filled with an infinite void, but infinite voids means infinite storage. 
Swirling his fingers around, his hand grazed something metal and cool.
Out of the hat he pulled a sword laiden in jewels. 

As he pulled out the sword from the hat, an arrow hit his head.
He woke up screaming laying on the ground halfway to the top of the mountain.
The man then remembers the pain but he realized his body is still in tact.
He then pulled out the sword and stayed alert.
A tree full of apples were spotted and he noticed he has not eaten for days.
He took a bite of an apple and it awakened his secret power.

Little did he know, he ate a devil fruit. This means he can no longer swim but this gave him powers.
His devil fruit is called the hat hat fruit, which allows him to spawn hats using command controls.
Spawn he did, spawning hats of all kind. However little did he know that his brother Dio also ate an devil fruit.
Now he must head towards the final battle for hat supremacy at Heavens peak.

Dio smirked as the hatted man neared him.
"Oh, so you're appoaching me?" He baited. "Instead of running away you're coming right to me?"
Dio bared his inhuman fangs and took his stance.

"Who are you?" He walks slowly towards Dio.
One side effect of the devil fruit is temporary amnesia and stupidity.
Dio stabbed the man and he passed out.
The man woke up where he took a bite of the apple.
He does not remember what happened to him after he awakened his power.
The man is unaware of his own powers.

All the man remembered was every instance of his deaths.
Being revived multiple times, betrayed by his own brother and eaten by an dragon had broken the hat man.
Walking back to his village he remembers Rem and Donkey before
his brother killed them, he lets out an cry and 
the man yells out "I AM SHREK, LAST MEMBER OF THE SWAMP FAMILY, I WILL AVENGE DONKEY".
His stand "All stars" had just awoken and with his final power awoken he finds the resolve to confont Dio again.
He tips his fedora and sets off again.
